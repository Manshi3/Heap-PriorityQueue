Identification

1) K de rkha hoga
2) Smallest/ largest

Trick to solve question -
K + smallest - take max heap
K + largest - take min heap

A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. .
